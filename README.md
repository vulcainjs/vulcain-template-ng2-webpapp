This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.

## PWA support
Offline support is configured with sw-precache and dedicated service worker

> To test offline, you first need to build the application `npm run build` and then prepare the application for caching with `npm run sw`. You can then run a `live-server` command right from the dist folder. Finally, you can check the offline checkbox from your browser dev tools under `Application \ Service Workers`

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You can also run the command `npm run start`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Docker

Use **dockerTask.ps1** or **dockerTask.ps** to build the Docker image depending on your platform (.ps1 for Windows, .sh for Linux/OSX)

The following commands are available:

> `./dockerTask.ps1 -Build -Environment Release` to build a release image

> `./dockerTask.ps1 -ComposeForDebug` uses a shared volumes to monitor the local `dist` folder and serve it through Express
